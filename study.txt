Wintertime sadness

I find that whenever the temperature is low, I feel sad and upset. I want to study the effects of weather, time of day, diet and other factors on my mood.

1.weather
2.Food
3.time of sleep
4.time of sunset

I will record all four sections daily and keep track of my mood and feelings for the day. Hopefully, at the end of this program, I will have a better understanding of how the external environment affects my emotions and will be able to self-regulate in an effective way.
